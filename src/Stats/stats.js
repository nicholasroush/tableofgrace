                    <p>"A new report released by the United Nations Environment Programme has revealed the shocking scale of global food waste. Its 2021 Food Waste Index estimates that people discard 931 million tonnes of food annually with per capita food waste averaging 74kg per household.</p>
                    <p>569 million tonnes falls into the category of household waste. Supermarkets and other businesses are also guilty of disposing of signficant quanities of food with the total amount discarded also adding up to hundreds of millions of tonnes per year. The report estimates that 244 million tonnes is wasted by food service annually while retail discards 118 million tonnes.</p>
                    <p>UNEP defines food waste as food that completes the food supply chain up to a final product, of good quality and fit for consumption, but still doesn't get consumed because it is discarded, whether or not after it is left to spoil or expire. Food waste typically (but not exclusively) takes place at retail and consumption stages in the food supply chain."</p>

                    <p>"In the push to reduce food waste there are calls for significant changes to be made to the current system of expiration dates. Most people have experienced the doubt and confusion when faced with a 'best before' or 'sell by' date and in a lot of cases the solution to this confusion is to err on the side of caution and throw it away. To be more precise, 'a lot of cases' equated to (or at least contributed to) an estimated 340 million tons of food wasted after purchase globally in 2015.</p>
                    <p>An overhaul of the system of these dates to bring more clarity could help reduce this kind of food waste and according to guidelines set out by the German Food Bank (Tafel Deutschland), the average expiration date for some products is far too conservative, with foods such as pasta and rice often edible for a year after the date on the package. Even products such as eggs, with which a lot of care is usually exercised, consumers could expect them to be consumable for an extra 21 days."</p>

                    <p>"About 14 percent of the world's food is lost before it even reaches retail. This is the conclusion of a report released this week by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The losses are particularly high for roots, tubers and oil-bearing crops (25.3 percent), followed by fruits and vegetables (21.6 percent). These numbers do not take into account food thrown away by retailers or by consumers themselves.</p>
                    <p>According to the report, the losses occur due to incorrect harvesting times, climatic conditions, incorrect harvesting techniques, poor storage and improper transport. Countries in Central and South Asia are particularly affected by food losses (20.7 percent). But North America and Europe (15.7 percent) also lose food at a rate that is above the world average (13.8 percent). Regions savvier about food waste are Australia and New Zealand (5.8 percent), the rest of Oceania (8.9 percent) as well as Eastern and Southeast Asia (7.8 percent)."</p>

                    <p>"New research published in the journal Plos One suggests that consumers waste more food than previously thought. A team around The Hague-based researcher Monika van den Bos Verma compared food availability and daily calorie intake in different countries and found that the average world citizen wasted 727 calories per day. In the U.S., that number was a lot higher at 1,572 calories per day â€“ the second on the list after Bermuda.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, one third of all food goes to waste before even reaching the market, according to the FAO. This is commonly known as food loss.</p>
                    <p>The researchers found that more affluent countries tend to throw out the most food, with Norway, Hong Kong and Germany all on the top of the list and developing countries wasting much smaller amounts. Out of the 177 countries that were part of the analysis, 40 were identified as not wasting any food per the study setup, since their food availability was below the daily caloric need of their inhabitants."</p>
